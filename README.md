# Vagrant project template
Template for new Vagrant projects

## Quick start
Run `vagrant up`

To run just a separate provisioner:
- `vagrant provision --provision-with <provisioner-name>`

- Example: `vagrant provision --provision-with install-packages`

### Git config
Default versions of .gitignore and .gitattributes files are auto-generated.
Don't forget to commit them.

### Get a quick start for your favorite programming language 
In the `install-packages.sh` vagrant provisioner there are some default installations for various programming languages to give you a quick start for developing your new project.

They are all commented. Just uncomment and install the ones you need.  

### Enjoy!
